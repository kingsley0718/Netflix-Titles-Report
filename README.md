# Netflix-Titles-Report

Prepared by Emeka Kingsley

## Executive Summary:
With the explosion of on-demand entertainment, Netflix has become a dominant global force in streaming, hosting a massive library of TV shows and movies. But have you ever wondered what types of content Netflix offers most, how its content has evolved over the years, or which countries dominate its library?


## Report:


##### In this project, we explore a public dataset of Netflix content to uncover trends in the types of shows, release timelines, content durations, genres (listed_in), countries, and key contributors like directors and cast. We investigate questions like:

i; What type of content (TV Shows or Movies) dominates the platform?

ii; How has content production changed over the years?

iii; Which countries contribute the most to Netflix’s library?

iv; What are the most popular genres listed?

v; Are there key patterns among top directors or star casts?



By transforming and visualizing this data, we aim to tell a compelling story of Netflix’s growth, global reach, and content strategy over time providing insights not only for analysts and media professionals, but for anyone curious about how one platform has reshaped modern entertainment.
